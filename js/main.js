            and digital marketing, where I have honed my skills in various programming 
            languages, frameworks, and tools. Currently, I am focused on building innovative tools that utilize AI to help companies
            automate processes, improve efficiency, and drive growth.

            Beyond technical skills, I have extensive experience in Account Management
            and Business Development, allowing me to bridge the gap between technical solutions and client needs. 
            I have a proven track record in delivering client-focused solutions and
